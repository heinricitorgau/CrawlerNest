# CrawlerNest ML

Modelling layer over the QS indicator data. It sits **beside** the deterministic
pipeline, never inside it: nothing here writes to `analytics.aggregated_rankings`
or changes a published rank, and every model output is stored and labelled as an
estimate. This is the same honesty contract the rest of the repo runs on — see
the "No black-box scores" rule in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

Status: **Phase 1 complete** (feature layer + EDA). No model is trained yet.

## The data

Built from `crawlernest/crawlernest-kb/databases/last_crawl_snapshot.json`, which
is committed — so everything here runs with no database and no network.

| | |
|---|---|
| Universities | 1,503 (QS 2026) |
| Indicators | 9, all present on every record |
| Countries | 107, grouped into 12 regions |
| Feature matrix | `(1503, 9)` indicators, `(1503, 21)` with region one-hot |

The target is QS's `Overall Score`, and its availability is the reason this is a
supervised problem at all:

```
rank    1– 600  →  Overall Score published   →  600 labelled rows  (training set)
rank  601–1503  →  Overall Score = "n/a"     →  903 unlabelled rows (inference set)
```

QS publishes the nine component indicators for all 1,503 universities but the
total only for the top 600.

`rank` is never a feature — QS derives the rank *from* the overall score, so
using it would leak the target. It is carried alongside the matrix for
evaluation only.

## Running it

```bash
./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
PYTHONPATH=crawlernest/crawlernest-ml ./.venv/bin/python -m ranking_ml.features.build_features
PYTHONPATH=crawlernest/crawlernest-ml ./.venv/bin/python -m ranking_ml.eda.run_eda
```

## Phase 1 findings

### 1. Missingness is small but real

Every indicator is *present* on every record, but some carry `"n/a"`:

| Indicator | Missing | % |
|---|---:|---:|
| International Faculty Ratio | 100 | 6.65 |
| International Student Ratio | 58 | 3.86 |
| Sustainability Score | 19 | 1.26 |
| International Research Network | 1 | 0.07 |
| the other five | 0 | 0.00 |

Median imputation is the current strategy. It is a decision, not a default —
`missingness_report()` exists so it stays visible.

### 2. The indicators line up with QS's published weighting

Correlation with `Overall Score` on the 600 labelled rows:

| Indicator | Pearson r | QS published weight |
|---|---:|---:|
| Academic Reputation | 0.901 | 30% |
| Employer Reputation | 0.777 | 15% |
| Employment Outcomes | 0.630 | 5% |
| Sustainability Score | 0.576 | 5% |
| International Research Network | 0.478 | 5% |
| Citations per Faculty | 0.476 | 20% |
| International Student Ratio | 0.405 | 5% |
| International Faculty Ratio | 0.351 | 5% |
| Faculty Student Ratio | 0.333 | 10% |

The ordering broadly tracks the published weights, with one worth noting:
**Citations per Faculty carries a 20% weight but correlates at only 0.476**,
below three indicators weighted at 5%. Whether a fitted model recovers the
published 20% is a concrete, checkable question for Phase 2 rather than a
hand-wave about feature importance.

### 3. Training set and inference set are not the same population

This is the finding that constrains Phase 2. Standardised difference in means
(Cohen's *d*) between the 600 labelled and 903 unlabelled rows:

| Indicator | Labelled mean | Unlabelled mean | Cohen's *d* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Sustainability Score | 49.98 | 6.88 | 1.91 |
| Academic Reputation | 37.72 | 8.70 | 1.68 |
| Citations per Faculty | 44.56 | 9.51 | 1.60 |
| International Research Network | 72.57 | 35.22 | 1.58 |
| Employer Reputation | 37.00 | 8.35 | 1.49 |
| International Faculty Ratio | 50.46 | 15.61 | 1.21 |
| Employment Outcomes | 40.02 | 13.06 | 1.13 |
| International Student Ratio | 41.86 | 13.74 | 1.03 |
| Faculty Student Ratio | 38.71 | 21.10 | 0.67 |

Every indicator shifts by more than 0.6 pooled standard deviations and most by
more than 1.0. Predicting the 903 from the 600 is **extrapolation, not
interpolation**.

![PCA scatter](artifacts/eda/pca_scatter.png)

PC1 alone explains 50.7% of the variance and orders the labelled rows almost
monotonically by rank. The unlabelled rows pile up at the low end of PC1, in a
region where the training data is sparse — though the two populations do overlap
around ranks 500–600, so predictions just past the cutoff rest on real support
and predictions deep in the tail do not.

**Consequences for Phase 2**, all of them arising from this figure:

1. A cross-validated RMSE on the 600 labelled rows measures how well the model
   recovers QS's scoring function. It does **not** estimate the error on the 903.
   Reporting it as though it did would be the exact kind of flattering,
   unfalsifiable number this repo's honesty contract exists to prevent.
2. Every prediction needs a **support flag** — a distance from the training
   distribution — and only predictions inside the supported region should be
   surfaced. This maps onto the existing mechanically-derived confidence rule
   rather than inventing a new one.
3. Spearman ρ between predicted score and QS's published rank on the 903 is not
   an optional extra. It is the only external validation available in the
   shifted region, because the ordering is known even though the scores are not.

## Next

Phase 2 trains the regressor against the published-weight baseline. Phase 3
adds the cross-source disagreement classifier and the LLM-evaluation upgrade.
